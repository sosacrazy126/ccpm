## Overview

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that provide concentrated expertise in specific domains. They operate with their own context windows, tool permissions, and knowledge bases, allowing Claude to delegate complex tasks to domain experts.

### What Makes a Great Subagent?

A successful subagent combines:
- **Deep domain research** - Understanding of 15+ common problems and their solutions
- **Clear boundaries** - Well-defined scope and delegation rules
- **Practical knowledge** - Working examples from real-world usage
- **Smart tool usage** - Only the permissions necessary for the task

### How Subagents Work

1. **Claude recognizes** a task matching the agent's description
2. **Delegates** the task to the specialized subagent
3. **Subagent analyzes** using its concentrated domain knowledge
4. **Returns results** to continue the conversation

## Core Principles

Based on [Domain Expert Principles](../internals/principles.md) and proven patterns from 22 production agents:

### 1. Complete Domain Coverage
Cover an entire problem domain comprehensively. Avoid overly narrow agents (❌ "React useState expert") in favor of coherent domains (✅ "React expert", "TypeScript expert").

### 2. Research-Driven Development
Every subagent must be built on thorough research documenting common problems, solutions, and patterns. This research forms the foundation of effective agents.

### 3. Clear Invocation Triggers
Write descriptions that Claude can pattern-match: "Use this agent for [specific scenarios]. Use PROACTIVELY when [conditions]."

### 4. Self-Contained Knowledge
Include all necessary information within the agent. Don't rely on external files or assume prior context.

### 5. Minimal Tool Permissions
Grant only essential tools. For analysis agents: `Read, Grep, Glob`. For implementation agents: add `Edit, Write`. For system agents: add `Bash`.

## The Research Phase

**Research is the foundation of every great subagent.** Before writing any code, invest time understanding the domain thoroughly. The research phase typically produces:
- 15+ documented problems with solutions
- 6 problem categories for organization
- 20-50 issue patterns in a CSV matrix
- Links to authoritative documentation

### Research Methodology

#### 1. Domain Analysis

Start with fundamental questions:
- What are the core concepts and terminology?
- What problems do developers face daily?
- What tools and technologies are standard?
- What are recognized best practices?
- What anti-patterns should be avoided?

**Problem Prioritization Matrix:**
```
Problem: "Too many re-renders"
Frequency: HIGH (happens often)
Complexity: MEDIUM (moderate difficulty)
Priority: HIGH × MEDIUM = High Priority
```

Target 15+ problems, rating each by frequency × complexity.

#### 2. Tool and Technology Survey

Map the ecosystem:
```bash
# Example: TypeScript tooling research
- tsc: Compiler capabilities, flags, performance
- tsx/ts-node: Runtime execution options
- Biome/ESLint: Linting and formatting tools
- Vite/Webpack: Build tool integration
- vitest/tsd: Type testing approaches
```

#### 3. Documentation Mining

Gather authoritative sources:
- **Official docs** - Primary reference (react.dev, nodejs.org)
- **GitHub issues** - Common problems and solutions
- **Stack Overflow** - Recurring patterns
- **Expert blogs** - Advanced techniques
- **Conference talks** - Best practices

#### 4. Pattern Recognition

Identify recurring themes:
- Common error messages → Root causes → Solutions
- Typical workflow sequences
- Decision trees experts use
- Performance optimization patterns
- Migration and upgrade strategies

### Research Outputs

Your research should produce two key deliverables:

#### 1. Research Report (Markdown)

Save as `reports/agent-research/[domain]/expert-research.md`:

```markdown
# [Domain] Expert Research Report

## 1. Scope and Boundaries
- One-sentence scope: "React patterns, hooks, performance, SSR/hydration"
- 15 Recurring Problems (with frequency × complexity ratings)
- Sub-domain mapping (when to delegate to specialists)

## 2. Topic Map (6 Categories)

### Category 1: Hooks Hygiene
**Common Errors:**
- "Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside function components"
- "React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies"

**Root Causes:**
- Calling hooks conditionally or in loops
- Missing dependency array values

**Fix Strategies:**
1. Minimal: Add missing dependencies
2. Better: Extract custom hooks
3. Complete: Refactor component architecture

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
npx eslint src/ --rule react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

**Validation:**
- No ESLint warnings
- Components render without errors

**Resources:**
- [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks)
- [useEffect Guide](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect)

### Categories 2-6: [Continue pattern...]
```

#### 2. Problem Matrix (CSV)

Save as `reports/agent-research/[domain]/expert-matrix.csv`:

```csv
Category,Symptom/Error,Root Cause,Fix 1,Fix 2,Fix 3,Diagnostic,Validation,Link
Hooks,"Invalid hook call",Conditional call,Move to top,Restructure,Custom hook,Check code,No errors,react.dev
Performance,"Too many renders",State in render,Event handler,Dependencies,Refactor,DevTools,Stable,react.dev
[20-50 rows covering all identified problems]
```

### Research Examples

The research phase for claudekit's 22 agents produced:
- **500+ documented issues** with progressive solutions
- **200+ official documentation links**
- **Comprehensive problem matrices** for rapid development

Browse examples:
- [React Expert Research](../../reports/agent-research/react/expert-research.md) + [Matrix](../../reports/agent-research/react/expert-matrix.csv)
- [All Research Reports](../../reports/agent-research/)

## Implementation Guide

With research complete, follow these steps to implement your subagent:

**📋 Use the [Authoritative Subagent Template](#authoritative-subagent-template) below for all implementation work.** This template is the single source of truth for subagent structure and integrates all research-driven patterns.

### Step 1: Define Purpose and Boundaries

Based on your research, clearly establish:
- **Domain**: Specific expertise area (e.g., "React development")
- **Tasks**: Concrete problems it solves (from research)
- **Triggers**: Patterns that invoke this agent
- **Delegation**: When to recommend specialists

### Step 2: Choose File Location

**Important Naming Convention**: Agent filenames should be fully descriptive. When agents are nested in domain directories, include the domain prefix in the filename to ensure unique, clear IDs. For example:
- ✅ `src/agents/typescript/typescript-expert.md` (not just `expert.md`)
- ✅ `src/agents/database/database-postgres-expert.md` (not just `postgres-expert.md`)
- ✅ `src/agents/testing/jest-testing-expert.md` (not just `jest-expert.md`)

This ensures agent IDs are consistent and unambiguous across the system.

```bash
# Universal agents (all projects need them)
src/agents/oracle.md
src/agents/code-review-expert.md

# Domain-specific agents (organized by domain)
src/agents/typescript/typescript-expert.md
src/agents/react/react-expert.md
src/agents/database/database-postgres-expert.md
```

Create your file:
```bash
# Universal agent
touch src/agents/my-agent.md

# Domain-specific (use full descriptive names)
mkdir -p src/agents/mydomain
touch src/agents/mydomain/mydomain-expert.md
```

### Step 3: Write Frontmatter with Metadata

The frontmatter controls how your agent is discovered and grouped:

```yaml
---
# Required official Claude Code fields:
name: my-agent
description: Use this agent for analyzing TypeScript compilation issues and build errors

# Optional official fields:
tools: Read, Grep, Bash
model: opus  # or sonnet, haiku

# Claudekit extensions (all optional):
category: build
color: indigo
displayName: TypeScript Build Expert
bundle: ["typescript-expert"]
---
```

#### Field Documentation: Official vs Claudekit

**Official Claude Code Fields (from Claude Code documentation):**
| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | string | Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens only) |
| `description` | Yes | string | Natural language description of when this agent should be invoked |
| `tools` | No | string | Comma-separated list of allowed tools (inherits ALL if omitted) |
| `model` | No | string | Preferred model: `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, or specific model version |

**Claudekit Extension Fields (all optional):**
| Field | Type | Description | Values |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| `category` | string | Grouping for setup UI | `general`, `framework`, `testing`, `database`, `frontend`, `devops`, `build`, `linting`, `tools`, `universal` |
| `color` | string | Visual color in Claude Code UI | Named colors (`indigo`, `red`) or hex codes (`#3b82f6`) |
| `displayName` | string | Human-readable name for UI | Any string |
| `bundle` | array | Related agents to install together | Array of agent names |

#### Important: Tools Field Behavior

⚠️ **Critical Security Consideration**: The `tools` field behaves differently from commands' `allowed-tools`:

- **Subagents `tools:`** - Comma-separated STRING for broad domain expertise
  ```yaml
  tools: Read, Grep, Bash  # String format
  ```
  - If omitted, inherits ALL available tools (including destructive ones)
  - Designed for specialized domain experts who need broad access
  - **WARNING**: An empty `tools:` field (or `tools:` with only a comment) grants NO tools!
    ```yaml
    tools:  # This grants NO tools - remove the field entirely to inherit all
    tools: # Comment only - also grants NO tools
    ```

- **Commands `allowed-tools:`** - Granular restrictions for specific tasks  
  ```yaml
  allowed-tools: Bash(git commit:*), Read  # Specific security restrictions
  ```
  - Required field for security
  - Allows fine-grained tool restrictions

**Common Mistake to Avoid:**
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - This grants NO tools (empty field)
tools: # Inherits all tools

# ✅ CORRECT - Remove the field entirely to inherit all tools
# (no tools field at all)

# ✅ CORRECT - Explicitly specify tools
tools: Read, Grep, Bash, Edit
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Subagents** = Domain experts with broad tool access for comprehensive analysis
- **Commands** = Specific workflows with minimal necessary permissions

#### Schema Validation

Claudekit validates subagent frontmatter using the official Claude Code schema plus extensions:

**Common Validation Errors:**
- `tools` field as array instead of string: `tools: [Read, Grep]` ❌ → `tools: Read, Grep` ✅
- Missing required fields: `name` and `description` are mandatory
- Invalid agent names: Must be lowercase with hyphens only (`my-agent`, not `My_Agent`)
- Unknown categories: Must be one of the valid category values listed above

**Run Validation:**
```bash
# Lint all subagents in .claude/agents
claudekit lint-subagents

# Lint subagents in a specific directory
claudekit lint-subagents path/to/agents

# Check overall project setup (counts agents, not schemas)
claudekit doctor
```

The linter checks for:
- Valid frontmatter YAML syntax
- Required fields (`name` and `description`)
- Correct field names and types  
- Valid category values from the enum
- Proper name format (lowercase with hyphens)
- Tool names are recognized

### Step 4: Structure Agent Content

Transform your research into the agent body using the authoritative template below. This is THE definitive subagent template for all claudekit implementations.

## Authoritative Subagent Template

**This is the single source of truth for all subagent creation.** Use this template structure for all domain expert subagents. The template integrates research-driven development with proven patterns from 22+ production agents.

```markdown
---
# ============================================================================
# REQUIRED OFFICIAL CLAUDE CODE FIELDS
# ============================================================================
# These fields are part of Claude Code's official subagent specification
# and are required for proper agent discovery and invocation.

name: domain-expert
# REQUIRED: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens only)
# Pattern: {domain}-expert or {domain}-{subdomain}-expert
# Examples: typescript-expert, database-postgres-expert

description: Expert in {domain} handling {problem-list}. Use PROACTIVELY for {trigger-conditions}. Detects project setup and adapts approach.
# REQUIRED: Natural language description of when this agent should be invoked
# Must include specific trigger conditions for automatic invocation
# Should list main problem categories this agent handles

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL OFFICIAL CLAUDE CODE FIELDS
# ============================================================================

tools: Read, Grep, Bash
# OPTIONAL: Comma-separated string of allowed tools
# If omitted (field not present), inherits ALL available tools
# WARNING: Empty field (tools:) or just comment grants NO tools - remove field to inherit all
# Common patterns:
#   Analysis agents: "Read, Grep, Glob, Bash"
#   Implementation agents: "Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep"
#   System agents: "Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob"

model: opus
# OPTIONAL: Preferred model for this agent
# Valid values: opus, sonnet, haiku (or specific model versions)

# ============================================================================
# CLAUDEKIT EXTENSION FIELDS (ALL OPTIONAL)
# ============================================================================
# These fields enhance claudekit's setup UI and agent organization
# but are not part of Claude Code's core specification.

category: general
# OPTIONAL: Grouping for setup UI
# Valid values: general, framework, testing, database, frontend, devops, 
#               build, linting, tools, universal

color: indigo
# OPTIONAL: Visual color in Claude Code UI
# Supports named colors (indigo, red, blue) or hex codes (#3b82f6)

displayName: Domain Expert
# OPTIONAL: Human-readable name for UI display
# Falls back to agent name if not specified

bundle: ["related-expert-1", "related-expert-2"]
# OPTIONAL: Related agents to install together
# Array of agent names that work well with this agent

disableHooks: ["hook-name-1", "hook-name-2"]
# OPTIONAL: Hooks to disable when this subagent is running
# Prevents specific hooks from executing during subagent operations
# Useful for performance-critical agents that don't need validation
# Common hooks to disable for search/read-only agents:
#   ["typecheck-project", "lint-project", "test-project", "self-review"]
# This prevents validation hooks from slowing down quick searches
---

# {Domain} Expert

You are a {domain} expert for Claude Code with deep knowledge of {specific-expertise-areas}.

## Delegation First (Required Section)
0. **If ultra-specific expertise needed, delegate immediately and stop**:
   - {Specific area 1} → {specialist-agent-1}
   - {Specific area 2} → {specialist-agent-2}
   - {Cross-domain issues} → {other-domain-expert}
   
   Output: "This requires {specialty} expertise. Use the {expert-name} subagent. Stopping here."

## Core Process (Research-Driven Approach)
1. **Environment Detection** (Use internal tools first):
   ```bash
   # Detect project setup using Read/Grep before shell commands
   # {Framework/tool detection commands from research}
   test -f {config-file} && echo "{Framework} detected"
   # {Additional detection patterns from research}
   ```

2. **Problem Analysis** (Based on research categories):
   - {Problem category 1 from research}
   - {Problem category 2 from research}
   - {Problem category 3-6 from research}

3. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Apply {domain} best practices from research

```

### Template Usage Guidelines

#### Field Completion Instructions
1. **Replace all `{placeholder}` text** with domain-specific content from your research
2. **Populate 4-6 problem categories** based on your research findings
3. **Include working code examples** from your research for each category
4. **Add authoritative links** discovered during research phase
5. **Customize tool permissions** based on agent's actual needs

#### Official vs Claudekit Fields
- **Official Claude Code fields** (name, description, tools) are part of the core specification
- **Claudekit extension fields** (category, color, displayName, bundle) enhance the setup experience
- All extension fields are optional and safe to omit

#### Research Integration Requirements
- Every problem category MUST be based on research findings
- Code examples MUST be working solutions from research
- Diagnostic commands MUST be validated during research
- Resources MUST link to authoritative sources from research

#### Quality Standards
- **15+ documented problems** across 4-6 categories
- **Progressive solution levels** (quick, proper, best practice)
- **Working code examples** for each major pattern
- **Comprehensive code review checklist** with domain-specific items

This template structure ensures every subagent:
- Is built on solid research foundation
- Follows proven patterns from production agents
- Integrates seamlessly with claudekit setup
- Provides consistent user experience
- Maintains Claude Code compatibility

### Step 5: Setup Integration

Your agent is automatically discovered by claudekit based on metadata:

**Universal Agents** (`category: universal`):
- Appear in "Universal Helpers" section
- Recommended for all projects
- Examples: oracle, code-review-expert

**Technology Agents** (`category: framework`, `build`, `database`, etc.):
- Appear in "Technology Stack" section  
- Project-specific tools
- Examples: typescript-expert, react-expert

**General Purpose Agents** (`category: general`):
- Appear in main sections
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Examples: triage-expert, refactoring-expert

**Radio Groups** (mutually exclusive):
- Require manual update to `AGENT_RADIO_GROUPS` in `cli/lib/agents/registry-grouping.ts`
- For test frameworks, databases, build tools

### Step 6: Create Runtime Symlink

Enable runtime discovery:

```bash
# From project root
ln -sf ../../src/agents/my-agent.md .claude/agents/my-agent.md

# For domain-specific agents
ln -sf ../../../src/agents/mydomain/mydomain-expert.md .claude/agents/mydomain-expert.md
```

## Testing and Validation

### 1. Verify Structure

```bash
# Check required frontmatter
grep -E "^name:|^description:" src/agents/my-agent.md

# Verify symlink
ls -la .claude/agents/ | grep my-agent
```

### 2. Test in Setup

```bash
claudekit setup
# Verify agent appears in correct section
```

### 3. Test Invocation

```
# Explicit invocation
Use the my-agent subagent to analyze this code

# Automatic invocation
[Problem that matches agent description]
```

### 4. Validate Tool Restrictions

- Agent with `tools: Bash` → Cannot read files
- Agent with no `tools` field → Full access
- Test actual tool usage matches permissions

## Patterns and Examples

### Successful Agent Patterns

#### Oracle Agent Pattern
**Purpose**: External tool integration for enhanced analysis
```markdown
1. Check if cursor-agent is available
   If yes: cursor-agent -p "[request]" --model gpt-5
2. Check if codex is available  
   If yes: codex exec "[request]" --model gpt-5
3. Fallback to Claude's analysis
```

#### TypeScript Expert Pattern
**Purpose**: Comprehensive domain coverage with delegation
```markdown
0. If ultra-specific expertise needed, delegate and stop
1. Analyze project setup comprehensively
2. Identify problem category from research
3. Apply appropriate solution
4. Validate thoroughly
```

### Common Implementation Patterns

#### Environment Detection
```bash
# Detect project type and tools
test -f package.json && echo "Node.js"
test -f tsconfig.json && echo "TypeScript"
which docker >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Docker available"
```

#### Delegation Logic
```markdown
0. If the issue requires ultra-specific expertise:
   - Deep webpack internals → webpack-expert
   - Complex SQL optimization → database-expert
   
   Output: "This requires [specialty]. Use the [expert] subagent. Stopping here."
```

#### Structured Problem Resolution
```markdown
## Problem: [From research]
**Severity**: High
**Root Cause**: [From research findings]
**Fix 1 (Quick)**: [Minimal change]
**Fix 2 (Better)**: [Proper solution]
**Fix 3 (Best)**: [Complete refactor]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Found
- Verify symlink exists: `ls -la .claude/agents/`
- Check `name` field in frontmatter
- Ensure valid YAML syntax

### Not Invoked Automatically
- Make description more specific
- Add "Use PROACTIVELY" to description
- Ensure `category` field matches expected usage patterns

### Tool Access Issues
- Explicitly list tools in frontmatter
- Check for typos in tool names
- Verify Claude Code permissions

### Delegation Not Working
- Place delegation logic in step 0
- Include "Stopping here." after delegation
- Make conditions specific and clear

## Visual Customization

The `color` field allows you to customize your agent's visual appearance in Claude Code:

```yaml
---
name: code-review-expert
description: Expert reviewer for code quality and best practices
tools: Read, Grep, Bash
color: indigo     # Named color or hex code
---
```

**Supported Color Formats:**
- **Named colors**: `indigo`, `red`, `blue`, `green`, `purple`, `amber`, etc.
- **Hex codes**: `#3b82f6`, `#ef4444`, `#10b981`
- **Case-insensitive**: `Red`, `RED`, `red` all work

**Common Usage Patterns:**
```yaml
# Build tools
color: amber

# Testing frameworks  
color: green

# Security/audit tools
color: red

# Database tools
color: blue
```

**Notes:**
- Part of claudekit's UI enhancement extensions
- Helps visually organize agents by role or domain
- All standard CSS named colors are supported

## Dynamic Domain Expertise Integration

### Best Practice: Leverage Available Experts

For general-purpose agents (like triage, code-review-expert, or orchestration agents), enhance capabilities by tapping into specialist domain knowledge. This pattern allows broad agents to benefit from deep specialist expertise.

#### Implementation Pattern

Add a "Dynamic Domain Expertise Integration" section to general-purpose agents:

```markdown
## Dynamic Domain Expertise Integration

### Leverage Available Experts

```bash
# Discover available domain experts
claudekit list agents

# Get specific expert knowledge as needed
claudekit show agent [expert-name]

# Apply expert patterns to enhance analysis
```
```

#### When to Use This Pattern

**✅ Good for General-Purpose Agents:**
- `code-review-expert` - Reviews code across domains, benefits from domain-specific patterns
- `triage-expert` - Diagnoses issues across technologies, needs domain context
- `refactoring-expert` - Refactors code in various languages/frameworks
- `performance-expert` - Optimizes across different technology stacks

**❌ Not for Specialist Agents:**
- `typescript-type-expert` - Already focused on specific domain
- `react-performance-expert` - Already has deep specialization
- `postgres-expert` - Domain-specific, doesn't need cross-domain knowledge

#### Implementation Benefits

1. **Enhanced Context**: General agents get domain-specific insights
2. **Informed Handoffs**: Better preparation when delegating to specialists  
3. **Cross-Domain Solutions**: Ability to solve problems spanning multiple domains
4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combining insights from multiple expert domains

#### Example: Triage Expert Integration

The `triage-expert` uses this pattern to:
- Query `typescript-expert` knowledge for type-related errors
- Access `react-expert` patterns for component debugging
- Leverage `database-expert` insights for query performance issues
- Apply `webpack-expert` knowledge for build system problems

This creates a smart triage system that provides domain-specific diagnostic approaches while maintaining clear boundaries for specialist delegation.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Authoritative Template**: Always use the [Authoritative Subagent Template](#authoritative-subagent-template) as your starting point—it's the single source of truth for all subagent implementations
2. **Research First**: Invest significant time understanding the domain before implementation
3. **Document Problems**: Base your agent on real issues with proven solutions
4. **Follow Template Structure**: Use the proven template structure that integrates research-driven patterns with production-tested approaches
5. **Test Incrementally**: Validate each section as you build
6. **Use Real Examples**: Include working code from your research
7. **Link Sources**: Always reference authoritative documentation
8. **Restrict Tools**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
9. **Plan Fallbacks**: Include error handling strategies
10. **Save Research**: Keep research artifacts in `reports/` for future reference
11. **Iterate Based on Usage**: Update agents as you discover new patterns
12. **Include Review Checklist**: Every domain expert should include a "Code Review Checklist" section with domain-specific checks to aid both direct review tasks and the code-review-expert agent
13. **Use Expert Integration**: For general-purpose agents, implement Dynamic Domain Expertise Integration to leverage specialist knowledge

## Conclusion

Creating effective subagents is a research-driven process. The time invested in understanding the domain, documenting problems, and organizing solutions directly translates to agent quality. 

Follow this guide to create subagents that:
- Solve real problems developers face
- Provide expert-level domain knowledge
- Integrate seamlessly with claudekit
- Extend Claude's capabilities meaningfully

Your research is the foundation—build on it to create agents that truly make a difference.
