# Modernize Setup Installer: From Shell Script to Cross-Platform CLI

**Status**: Draft  
**Authors**: Claude, 2025-07-13

## Overview

Replace the current monolithic bash setup.sh script with a modern TypeScript CLI installer that provides interactive wizard flows, non-interactive CI/CD support, and selective component installation for macOS and Linux. The new installer will be distributed as an npm package and maintain backward compatibility during transition.

## Background/Problem Statement

The current `setup.sh` is a 108-line bash script that works but has significant limitations:

### Current Issues
- **Readability**: While better than the original one-liner, still lacks clear separation of concerns
- **POSIX-only**: Relies on bash, `read -p`, hard-coded `~/.claude`, ANSI colors, assumes Unix environment
- **All-or-nothing**: Copies all commands and hooks without user choice
- **No CI support**: Requires interactive input, impossible to run from CI or larger scripts
- **POSIX-only limitations**: Restricts user base to Unix-like systems
- **Limited UX**: Basic prompts with no validation or rich interactions
- **No idempotency**: Always copies files regardless of whether they've changed
- **No rollback**: No way to undo installation or selectively remove components

### Why Change Now
- Need for automated CI/CD workflows
- Request for selective installation (only specific hooks/commands)
- Better developer experience with rich prompts and validation
- Foundation for future extensibility (plugin system, updates, etc.)
- Cleaner codebase for maintenance and testing

## Goals

- ✅ **Unix platform support**: Work on macOS and Linux
- ✅ **Interactive wizard**: Rich prompts with validation, checkboxes, confirmations
- ✅ **Non-interactive mode**: Full CI/CD support with flags
- ✅ **Selective installation**: Choose specific commands and hooks
- ✅ **Idempotency**: Only update files when changed (SHA-256 comparison)
- ✅ **Rich UX**: Progress indicators, colored output, error handling
- ✅ **Rollback capability**: Uninstall and selective removal
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Keep existing setup.sh during transition
- ✅ **Zero global install**: Use `npx claudekit setup`
- ✅ **Extensible**: Foundation for future features (updates, plugins)

## Non-Goals

- ❌ **Rewriting existing hooks/commands**: Only changing the installer
- ❌ **Breaking changes**: Must maintain same file locations and formats
- ❌ **Custom package manager**: Use npm for distribution
- ❌ **Complex plugin system**: Keep it simple for v1
- ❌ **GUI installer**: Stay in terminal for consistency with Claude Code
- ❌ **Multiple languages**: TypeScript only for maintainability

## Technical Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Node.js**: >=20.0.0 (for stable ESM and performance)
- **@inquirer/prompts**: ^7.6.0 - Modern prompts with TypeScript support
- **commander**: ^14.0.0 - CLI argument parsing and subcommands
- **ora**: ^8.2.0 - Elegant terminal spinners
- **picocolors**: ^1.1.0 - Lightweight terminal colors (7KB vs chalk's 101KB)
- **fs-extra**: ^11.3.0 - Enhanced file system operations

### Development Dependencies
- **TypeScript**: ^5.8.0 - Latest stable with improved ESM support
- **esbuild**: ^0.25.0 - Fast bundling for distribution

- **Local dev**: `pnpm build && pnpm link`
- **Package format**: Pure ESM with proper Node.js 20+ support
- **Release automation**: AI-powered release preparation with automated workflows

#### Release Infrastructure
Borrowing proven release automation from the autoagent project:

1. **AI-Powered Release Preparation** (`scripts/prepare-release.sh`):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   Please do the following:
   1. Check the published version using: npm view claudekit version
   2. Find the last release tag using: git describe --tags --abbrev=0
   2. Get the actual changes since that tag using: git diff <last-tag>..HEAD --stat and git diff <last-tag>..HEAD
   3. Analyze the ACTUAL CODE CHANGES (not just commit messages) and write accurate changelog entries:
      - Fixed: bug fixes (what was actually fixed in the code)
      - Added: new features (what new functionality was added)
      - Changed: changes to existing functionality (what behavior changed)
      - Removed: removed features (what was deleted)
      - Security: security fixes
      - Documentation: documentation only changes
   4. DO NOT just copy commit messages. Look at what files changed and what the changes actually do.
   5. Update CHANGELOG.md with a new section for the new version, organizing changes by category
   6. Update the version in package.json using: npm version $RELEASE_TYPE --no-git-tag-version
   7. Create a git commit with message \"chore: prepare for vX.X.X release\" where X.X.X is the new version
   
   Follow the Keep a Changelog format and include the date. Only include categories that have changes.
   
   DO NOT create a git tag - the GitHub Actions workflow will create it during the release process."

### Core Architecture

#### 1. Component System
```typescript
interface Component {
  id: string;
  type: 'command' | 'hook';
  name: string;
  description: string;
  path: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  platforms: Platform[];
  category: string;
}

interface ProjectInfo {
  hasTypeScript: boolean;
  hasESLint: boolean;
  packageManager: 'npm' | 'yarn' | 'pnpm' | null;
  projectPath: string;
}

interface Installation {
  components: Component[];
  target: InstallTarget;
  backup: boolean;
  dryRun: boolean;
  projectInfo?: ProjectInfo;
}
```

#### 2. Installation Flow
```typescript
// Interactive mode with smart detection
const projectInfo = await detectProjectContext(process.cwd());
const recommendedComponents = recommendComponents(projectInfo);
const components = await selectComponents(recommendedComponents);
const target = await selectTarget();
const options = await configureOptions();

// Non-interactive mode
const projectInfo = await detectProjectContext(flags.project || process.cwd());
const components = parseComponentsFlag(flags.components) || recommendComponents(projectInfo);
const target = resolveTarget(flags.project || process.cwd());
```

#### 3. File Operations
- **Idempotency**: SHA-256 comparison before copying
- **Backup**: Automatic backup of existing files
- **Atomic**: All-or-nothing installation with rollback
- **Unix-focused**: Use `path.join`, `os.homedir()`, standard Unix permissions
- **Path Resolution**: Convert relative paths to absolute paths in settings.json
- **Dependency Management**: Auto-include required dependencies (validation-lib.sh)

### User Experience

# Update all components
npx claudekit update
```

### Implementation Details

#### Project Type Detection
```typescript
async function detectProjectContext(projectPath: string): Promise<ProjectInfo> {
  const resolvedPath = resolveProjectPath(projectPath);
  
  return {
    hasTypeScript: await fs.pathExists(path.join(resolvedPath, 'tsconfig.json')),
    hasESLint: await hasEslintConfig(resolvedPath),
    packageManager: await detectPackageManager(resolvedPath),
    projectPath: resolvedPath
  };
}

function recommendComponents(projectInfo: ProjectInfo): Component[] {
  const recommended = [];
  
  if (projectInfo.hasTypeScript) {
    recommended.push('typecheck.sh');
    recommended.push('validation-lib.sh'); // Auto-include dependency
  }
  
  if (projectInfo.hasESLint) {
    recommended.push('eslint.sh');
    recommended.push('validation-lib.sh'); // Auto-include dependency
  }
  
  return recommended;
}

async function hasEslintConfig(projectPath: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const configFiles = ['.eslintrc.json', '.eslintrc.js', '.eslintrc.yaml', 'eslint.config.js'];
  for (const file of configFiles) {
    if (await fs.pathExists(path.join(projectPath, file))) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

#### Path Resolution Enhancement
```typescript
function resolveProjectPath(inputPath: string): string {
  // Handle ~/ expansion
  const expanded = inputPath.startsWith('~/')
    ? path.join(os.homedir(), inputPath.slice(2))
    : inputPath;
  
  // Resolve symlinks and convert to absolute path
  return fs.realpathSync(path.resolve(expanded));
}

function generateSettings(components: Component[], projectPath: string): ClaudeSettings {
  const hookConfigs = components
    .filter(c => c.type === 'hook')
    .map(component => ({
      matcher: getFilePattern(component.name),
      script: path.resolve(projectPath, '.claude', 'hooks', component.filename)
    }));

  return {
    hooks: {
      PostToolUse: hookConfigs
    }
  };
}

function getFilePattern(hookName: string): string {
  switch (hookName) {
    case 'typecheck.sh': return '\\.(ts|tsx)$';
    case 'eslint.sh': return '\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$';
    default: return '.*';
  }
}
```

#### Dependency Resolution
```typescript
const DEPENDENCIES = {
  'typecheck.sh': ['validation-lib.sh'],
  'eslint.sh': ['validation-lib.sh']
};

function resolveDependencies(selectedComponents: Component[]): Component[] {
  const resolved = new Set(selectedComponents.map(c => c.name));
  
  selectedComponents.forEach(component => {
    const deps = DEPENDENCIES[component.name];
    if (deps) {
      deps.forEach(dep => resolved.add(dep));
    }
  });
  
  return Array.from(resolved).map(name => findComponent(name));
}
```

#### Prerequisite Validation
```typescript
async function validatePrerequisites(components: Component[], projectInfo: ProjectInfo): Promise<ValidationResult[]> {
  const results = [];
  
  for (const component of components) {
    switch (component.name) {
      case 'typecheck.sh':
        results.push(await validateTypeScript(projectInfo));
        break;
      case 'eslint.sh':
        results.push(await validateESLint(projectInfo));
        break;
    }
  }
  
  return results;
}

async function validateTypeScript(projectInfo: ProjectInfo): Promise<ValidationResult> {
  if (!projectInfo.hasTypeScript) {
    return {
      component: 'typecheck.sh',
      valid: false,
      message: 'TypeScript hook selected but no tsconfig.json found',
      suggestion: 'Initialize TypeScript with: npx tsc --init'
    };
  }
  
  // Check if tsc is available
  const hasTsc = await checkCommand('tsc');
  return {
    component: 'typecheck.sh',
    valid: hasTsc,
    message: hasTsc ? 'TypeScript configured correctly' : 'TypeScript compiler not found',
    suggestion: hasTsc ? null : 'Install TypeScript: npm install -g typescript'
  };
}

async function validateESLint(projectInfo: ProjectInfo): Promise<ValidationResult> {
  if (!projectInfo.hasESLint) {
    return {
      component: 'eslint.sh',
      valid: false,
      message: 'ESLint hook selected but no ESLint config found',
      suggestion: 'Initialize ESLint with: npx eslint --init'
    };
  }
  
  return {
    component: 'eslint.sh',
    valid: true,
    message: 'ESLint configured correctly'
  };
}
```

#### Unix Platform Implementation
```typescript
import { createColors } from 'picocolors';

// Path handling
const userDir = os.homedir();
const claudeDir = path.join(userDir, '.claude');

// Lightweight colors (7KB vs 101KB for chalk)
const colors = createColors(process.stdout.isTTY);

// File permissions (Unix systems)
await fs.chmod(hookPath, 0o755);

// Platform validation
if (process.platform === 'win32') {
  throw new Error('Windows is not supported in this version. Please use WSL or macOS/Linux.');
}
```

#### Idempotency Implementation
```typescript
async function needsUpdate(source: string, target: string): Promise<boolean> {
  if (!await fs.pathExists(target)) return true;
  
  const sourceHash = await getFileHash(source);
  const targetHash = await getFileHash(target);
  
  return sourceHash !== targetHash;
}

async function getFileHash(filePath: string): Promise<string> {
  const content = await fs.readFile(filePath);
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(content).digest('hex');
}
```

#### Enhanced Settings Merge Strategy
```typescript
interface HookConfig {
  matcher: string;
  hooks: Array<{ type: string; command: string }>;
}

interface ClaudeSettings {
  hooks: Record<string, HookConfig[]>;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

async function mergeSettings(claudeSettings: ClaudeSettings, existingSettings: ClaudeSettings): Promise<ClaudeSettings> {
  const result = { ...existingSettings };
  
  // Handle complex hook structure with matchers
  for (const [event, claudeHooks] of Object.entries(claudeSettings.hooks || {})) {
    const existingHooks = existingSettings.hooks?.[event] || [];
    
    // Merge hooks while preserving matcher structure
    const allHooks = [...existingHooks, ...claudeHooks];
    
    // Deduplicate based on command path
    const uniqueHooks = allHooks.filter((hook, index) => {
      return !allHooks.slice(0, index).some(h => 
        h.matcher === hook.matcher && 
        JSON.stringify(h.hooks) === JSON.stringify(hook.hooks)
      );
    });
    
    result.hooks = { ...result.hooks, [event]: uniqueHooks };
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- **Component discovery**: Test component metadata parsing
- **File operations**: Test copy, backup, restore with mocks
- **Unix path handling**: Test path resolution on macOS and Linux
- **Settings merge**: Test various merge scenarios
- **Validation**: Test input validation edge cases

#### Integration Tests  
- **Full installation flow**: Test complete wizard in headless mode
- **Non-interactive mode**: Test all flag combinations
- **Rollback scenarios**: Test installation failures and cleanup
- **Platform compatibility**: Test on macOS and Linux (via CI)

#### E2E Tests
- **Real file system**: Test actual file operations (isolated)
- **Claude Code integration**: Verify commands work after installation
- **Update scenarios**: Test updating from previous versions

#### Mock Strategy
```typescript
// Mock file system for unit tests
vi.mock('fs-extra', () => ({
  pathExists: vi.fn(),
  copy: vi.fn(),
  readFile: vi.fn(),
  writeFile: vi.fn(),
  ensureDir: vi.fn(),
}));

// Mock prompts for non-interactive testing
vi.mock('@inquirer/prompts', () => ({
  checkbox: vi.fn(),
  input: vi.fn(),
  confirm: vi.fn(),
}));
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Lazy loading**: Only load required components
- **Concurrent operations**: Parallel file operations where safe
- **Caching**: Cache component metadata and file hashes
- **Incremental updates**: Only process changed files

### Performance Targets
- **Cold start**: < 2 seconds for `npx claudekit setup --help`
- **Full installation**: < 10 seconds for complete setup
- **Component discovery**: < 500ms to scan all available components
- **File operations**: Batch operations for better I/O performance

## Basic Safety Considerations

### File System Safety
- **Path validation**: Basic checks for reasonable paths
- **Permission checks**: Verify write permissions before operations
- **Backup creation**: Simple backup before overwriting files
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure with helpful messages

### Input Validation
```typescript
function validateProjectPath(input: string): boolean {
  const resolved = path.resolve(input);
  
  // Basic safety checks
  if (!resolved || resolved.length < 3) return false;
  if (resolved.includes('..')) return false;
  
  // Ensure it's a valid directory
  return fs.pathExistsSync(resolved);
}

function sanitizeComponentList(components: string[]): string[] {
  return components
    .filter(c => typeof c === 'string')
    .filter(c => /^[a-z0-9:-]+$/.test(c))
    .filter(c => availableComponents.has(c))
    .slice(0, 50); // Reasonable limit
}
```

### Dependency Security
- **Lock file**: Use package-lock.json for reproducible builds
- **Audit**: Regular `npm audit` in CI
- **Minimal dependencies**: Keep dependency tree small
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
